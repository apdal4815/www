#### Abstract

The 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
adopted Resolution 70/1, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and
prosperity. Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is the
greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for
sustainable development.
As a specialized agency of the United Nations, the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) contributes to the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 13 on climate action as
the co-custodian through the maintenance and expansion of its
Members' atmospheric, oceanographic and land-based observational
networks, the free unrestricted exchange of the resulting data and
information and related capacity development and research in order
to optimize the production of weather, climate and waterrelated
services worldwide.
The WMO community's challenge is to provide decision-makers with
the scientific facts and analyses they need to adapt to climate change
impacts and build climate resilience. In addition to hosting the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Global Climate
Observing System (GCOS), WMO is promoting international action
and cooperation on climate change. WMO’s Contribution to SDG-13
is based on the results-based framework and mechanism through
the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), the Climate
Services Information System and the Multi-Hazard Early Warning
System. The contribution of WMO to the SDGs will be introduced.
